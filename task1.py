# We are using IMDB review dataset
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import imdb  #to import the imdb dataset

# We will only use the most used 10,000 words and the rest will be ignored

'''
Here each word is actually represented by a number value instead of the word.
As neural networks dont understand text they only understand numbers.

0 represents a negative review and 1 represents a positive review.

'''There is a helper function that can help us get the token for the corresponding word.'''

# Decoding the Reviews
#The decoded part is for our referance... for the decodng we use a dictionary where
# the key values paris.

All these reviews are of different lengths
